    Using scoped locks in cpp wrapper
    
    I added scoped locks to the Mutex class which use the RIIA idiom
    to ensure that any lock is unlocked whatever the control path you
    take. This enables the simplification of some methods by doing
    early exists.

    Allow devices with different callbacks
    
    Simplification of the c++ interface by making the context not being
    a template and by templating just the creation method.
    Besides the simplification of removing templated objects, this allows
    the context to hold devices of different types (with different callbacks).
