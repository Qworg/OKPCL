This code bridges OpenKinect, PCL, and OpenCV in C++.

It also includes some fun tricks, like background subtraction and on the fly multiple Kinect calibration.
   
OKCV - OpenKinect and OpenCV bridge.
OKCVCalib - OpenKinect and OpenCV calibration system.
OKCVDouble - OpenKinect and OpenCV double Kinect calibration.
OKFlower - OpenKinect and PCL flipping a bit on an Arduino.
OKPCLDouble - OpenKinect and PCL double Kinect point clouds.
OKShutter - OpenKinect and PCL double Kinect with mechanical shutters - stops interference between multiple Kinects
OKStereo - OpenKinect, OpenCV, and PCL double Kinect automatic calibration and point cloud positioning.

Please note this code requires the qworg branch of libfreenect - it modifies some files to allow for binding between PCL and OpenKinect.
